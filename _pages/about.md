Welcome! I am a physicist working in the quantum computing industry at [Xanadu](https://xanadu.ai).
I specialize in high performance software development. Typically my job entails writing code for supercomputers, AWS clusters, accelerators (e.g. GPUs), or optimizing existing codes that need a speed boost.

Here you'll find my full resume as well as links to my github, google scholar and other ways to contact/follow me.
I also write the occasional blog post on topics that fascinate me.
